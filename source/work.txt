Protect The Football
====================
Tech: rails, impactJS, hype, heroku
Role: backend, js, animation
Desc: Make it on the leaderboard and win big prizes with these 2 HTML5 games for Bufallo Wild Wings.

I worked primarily building out the scoring and leaderboard functionality (including code to detect cheaters) as well as building the IE/mobile HTML-based card-matching game to compliment the canvas-based platformer.  I got some experience with impactJS working on the cutscenes and game flow logic, in addition to also animating the scoreboard screen.

Cambria
=======
Tech: middleman, google maps
Role: animations, js, layout
Desc: Beautiful design met awesome interactive features for this premium countertop company.

I'm still impressed with what designer Dan Jenstad and I were able to achieve in the three "dream scene" animated homepages, especially consider they were built in 2010 when CSS based animations were pretty new (and it being my first stab at animations).  I combined trusty js image spriting with lots of research into css transitions/3dtransforms/keyframes to create effects that looked like they were made in flash but could run smoothly on an ipad1, with fallback animations for ie7.  I did some other misc. layout on the site and built the store locator.

3m Innovation
=============
Tech: jruby, rails, rails_admin
Role: backend, js, sysadmin, layout, animation
Desc: A clean, fully responsive site showcasing 3m's innovative technologies and the stories it has created.

I led the backend development of a rails_admin based CMS, add in support for multi-server publishing, i18n, and dozens of custom components that powered the rich front-end stories showcased on the site.  It was "enterprise ready" with jruby deployed on tomcat, along with an oracle database.

I also did frontend + backend integration with a host of social sharing sites, layout and js for the map page, built a js responsive image swapper, integration with the brightcove video api, and a custom animation or two.

Lookbook
========
Tech: rails, backbone, heroku, wkhtmltopdf, s3, dragonfly
Role: backend, js, layout
Desc: Webapp to let healthcare sales team generate a mock pdf to show their clients what their custom portal will look like.

This was a lot of fun to work on as it combined a rich single page editing UI built with backbone in coffeescript, with a backend that scaled and cropped logos, generated a pdf, and used s3 for data storage.  I worked primarily on the backend admin screens, s3 data storage, and deployment, but also got my hands in a good chunk of the js editing code too.

Orange Julius
=============
Tech: googlemaps
Role: js, layout, animations
Desc: A website for smoothies, built on a .net CMS.

I took care of the wacky layout and several interactive widgets on the homepage, including CMS-able animations built out of several customizable layers.  I worked on the map page as well and probably a little layout here and there.

Curo
====
Tech: KnockoutJS
Role: js
Desc: We laughed complex branching and validation requirements in the face on this Doctor Search app using the data-binding capabilities of KnockoutJS.

Long forms that branched based on users input, insane validation, custom input widgets, auto-save, and syncing data between multiple widgets on a page made this not your typical form-based app.  Midway through I ripped out the jquery.validate library we'd been hacking around to write a pure knockout-based validation library.  I walked away really impressed with the speed we were able to create and change behavior using data binding.

Why I'm Here
============
Tech: rails, twillio, heroku
Role: backend, layout
Desc: App to let employees submit online or as a text message why they liked working for OptumHealth, with moderated posts appearing on large screens throughout the corporate campus.

I built the backend to this fun little project which used Twillio for SMS integration and had a basic admin approval process.  Data was exposed via web services to the frontend Flash-based video display.  My first production app deployed to heroku.

Wingers
=======
Tech: middleman
Role: animation, layout
Desc: Scroll to send this wing on a parachute jump, through a ring of fire, and finish with a spinning plop into a cup of sauce.

This was a fun animation project to promote a new type of wings for Buffalo Wild Wings.  Scrolling the page moved the wing through a series of CSS and JS based animations.  Try scrolling the wing back and forward through the fire to launch an army of tiny parachutes.  Keep clicking on the wing and you might see an easter egg (or two).

Magellan
========
Tech: rails, merb, backbone, googlemaps, jammit
Role: backend, js, sysadmin, layout
Desc: Find travel offices for American Express worked 100% with javascript turned off.

I was the backend developer on this projected tasked with combining two existing merb applications into a single rails 3.0 app, while replacing mapquest with google maps and making *significant* accessibility enhancements.  Namely, the entire experience of paginating through results on a map had to work without javascript, using the google maps static image api.  When the page loaded it would use js if available to turn it into a dynamic ajax map experience, even sharing the same mustache-based templates with the server.

I wrote a fairly robust mapping UI library in backbone, with pluggable features like a results pane, map tooltips, pagination, filtering, and ajax updates to accomodate the two slightly different maps in the merged app, and I was able to use it in several other projects as well.  This site recently got an updated design, which I helped out in the planning stages and to setup the new server.

Cambria Color Picker
====================
Tech: jqueryui
Role: js, layout
Desc: Facebook tab app to filter cambria's tiles.

This was one of my first projects working at space150 but I still pretty proud of the quality of the js code for this one.  To make filtering fast even in ie6 I based the filtering logic on bitmasks, creating a small Bitmask class which called `valueOf` on all operands to work polymorphicly on other Bitmasks or plain numbers.  The backend attached bitmask values via data- attributes (before it was cool!) so the frontend was completely agnostic to the meaning of a given bitmask, making updates easy.  The page had a jquery ui widget for the list, the filter, and a parent that listened to events and communicated between the two.  Pretty dece.

Cakes.com
=========
Tech: rails
Role: backend, js
Desc: Consumer facing frontend site with a backend store cake ordering system.

I came on to help add several JS and rails features to the backend ordering system.  Over time I assumed the role of primary maintainer for the CMS frontend and ordering backend site, helping to add several additional features.

King Fantastic
==============
Tech: html
Role: layout, js
Desc: Upload your photo to get a 3d render of your face in the music video

Sadly this site is no longer around, but I did the responsive layout and js that integrated with the flash-based image uploader and video player.  It used hashbang urls to track state throughout the app, and was fun as I decided to write it without using jquery.
